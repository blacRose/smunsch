I'm pretty sure the reason I broke up with Meph and Mira was almost entirely from my brain injury's various effects. Looking back, people needing alone time wouldn't have ever been a problem for me - And wouldn't have been a cancel point before my injury. That, and feeling incredibly worthless, and like change would be impossible for me. I wrote this because, looking back on it, I feel horrible about it, and hope showing this to them now, and waiting until after I've had a full year of neuroplasticity's work that they will take my ungrateful ass back. I realize I'm writing this on November 29th, but I am predicting my stupid future reactions to stuff. Also, another upside is that I start hormones on the fourteenth. So, my emotions will hopefully come back forcefully if they haven't already from therapy.
