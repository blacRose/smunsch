<h2 id="1">"Magnolia"<p>The Hush Sound</p></h2>

Your heartbeat is pulsing at night in your chest

It's gold and it's glowing with all the life you have left

I received your words from hospitals where you felt alone

Your words like smoke, they made me sick but they kept me warm

----

Run where you'll be safe

Through the garden gates

To the shelter of magnolias

----

Your eyes are like sea glass, so weathered and worn

From all they've seen of adolescence torn

The lovers who have tainted you, they pulled you into the night

They touched your skin with velvet gloves and made you feel alive

----

Run where you'll be safe

Through the garden gates

To the shelter of magnolias

There's not much time

The blush in the sky begins to fade

----

You are weathered and worn

Your petals soft and torn

The fading color

You have bent your shoulders

To hold the weight of the world

You will surely shatter

----

Run where you'll be safe

Through the garden gates

To the shelter of magnolias

There's not much time

The blush in the sky begins to fade

----

<h2 id="2">"Celebration Guns"<p>Stars</p></h2>

So tomorrow there will be another number

For the one who had a name

A desert wind and a perverse desire to win

History buried in shame

----

[Chorus (x2):]

All the beating drums

Celebration guns

The thunder and the laughter

The last thing they remember

----

And then the next day

How will you know your enemy

By their colour or your fear

One by one you can cage them

In your freedom

Make them all disappear

----

Six hundred sixty-six

Hundred sixty days

Two guards went uncharged

This morning's paper's ink stains my fingers

Our hands grow darker everyday

----

[Chorus (x4)]

----

Goodnight, sleep light, stranger [repeat (x3)]

----

<h2 id="3">"Calendar Girl"<p>Stars</p></h2>

If I am lost for a day; try to find me

But if I don't come back, then I won't look behind me

And all of the things that I thought were so easy

Just got harder and harder each day

December is darkest, in June there's the light

But this empty bedroom won't make anything right

While out on the landing a friend I forgot to send home

Who waits up for me all through the night

----

Calendar Girl who's in love with the world

Stay alive

Calendar Girl who's in love with the world

Stay alive

----

I dreamed I was dying; as I so often do

And when I awoke I was sure it was true

I ran to the window; threw my head to the sky

And said "whoever is up there, please don't let me die"

But I can't live forever, I can't always be

One day I'll be sand on a beach by a sea

The pages keep turning, I'll mark off each day with a cross

And I'll laugh about all that we've lost

----

Calendar Girl who is lost to the world

Stay alive

Calendar Girl who is lost to the world

Stay alive

----

January, February, March, April, May

I'm alive

June, July, August, September,October

I'm alive

November, December, yeah all through the winter

I'm alive

I'm alive

----

<h2 id="4">"You Are The Moon"<p>The Hush Sound</p></h2>

Shadows all around you as you surface from the dark

Emerging from the gentle grip of night's unfolding arms

Darkness, darkness everywhere, do you feel all alone?

The subtle grace of gravity, the heavy weight of stone

----

You don't see what you possess, a beauty calm and clear

It floods the sky and blurs the darkness like a chandelier

All the light that you possess is skewed by lakes and seas

The shattered surface, so imperfect, is all that you believe

----

I will bring a mirror, so silver, so exact

So precise and so pristine, a perfect pane of glass

I will set the mirror up to face the blackened sky

You will see your beauty every moment that you rise

----

<h2 id="5">"Going Going Gone"<p>Stars</p></h2>

Going, going, going, going… Gone

----

Still hooked on cellophane

Hanging 'round the mall and all

Each penny numbs the pain

Sends you gently for the fall

I followed you last night

I saw you turn your lights out

I knew it wasn't right

I watched in fear and doubt

It's gotten to be that way

(Going, going, gone)

What did you do today

(Going, going, gone)

----

Look good in that red dress

I bet the boyfriend's happy

Your face is scarred with age

You're twenty-three

But how can that be

You're still hooked on cellophane

Killing time with gin and lime

Each second numbs the pain

Love's just another rhyme

It's gotten to be that way

(Going, going, gone)

I'm scared but I'm okay

(Going, going, gone)

----

There's nowhere to move on

There's nowhere to move on

All I see again

All I see

All I see again

All I see

All I see again

All I see

All I see again

Is me everywhere

It's me...

Dah da dah da do dut dah

Dah da dah da do dut dah

Dah da dah da do dut dah

Dah da dah da do dut dah

Dah da dah da do dut dah

Dah da dah da do dut dah

----

<h2 id="6">"Love Myself"<p>Hailee Steinfeld</p></h2>

When I get chills at night

I feel it deep inside without you, yeah

Know how to satisfy

Keeping that tempo right without you, yeah

----

Pictures in my mind on replay

I'm gonna touch the pain away

I know how to scream my own name

Scream my name

Feeling good on my own without you, yeah

The beautiful, it comes without you, yeah

And love me so hard 'til it hurts

I know how to scream out the words

Scream the words

<h2 id="7">"Girl Crush"<p>Little Big Town</p></h2>

Got a girl crush, hate to admit it but

I got a heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down

I got it real bad, want everything she has

That smile and the midnight laugh she’s givin’ you now

----

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you

I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume

I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch

Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much

I got a girl crush, I got a girl crush

I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace

Talk to me and watch me crumble

You will see me come undone

Faithfully I will look over

There I'll find what you've become

(What you've become)

----

You help me lose my mind

And you bring me something I can't define

Help me lose my mind, make me wonder

What I felt before

Keep biding my time,

Jealousy will be washed over

Carefully we look on through

Could it be easy to start over?

<h2 id="10">"Coin-Operated Boy"<p>Dresden Dolls</p></h2>

Coin operated boy, sitting on the shelf

He is just a toy but I turn him on and he comes to life

Automatic joy that is why I want

A coin operated boy

----

Made of plastic and elastic

He is rugged and long lasting

Who could ever ever ask for more?

Love without complications galore

----

Many shapes and weights to chose from

I will never leave my bedroom

I will never cry at night again

Wrap my arms around him and pretend

----

Coin operated boy

All the other real ones that I destroy

Cannot hold a candle to my new boy

And I'll never let him go

----

And I'll never be alone

And I'll never let him go

And I'll never be alone, go

And I'll never be alone, go

----

And I'll never be alone, go

And I'll never be alone, go

And I'll never be alone

Not with my coin operated boy

----

This bridge was written to make you feel smitten

And with my sad picture of girl getting bitterer

Oh, can you extract me from my plastic fantasy

I didn't think so but I'm still convincible

----

Oh will you persist even after I bet you a million dollars

That I'll never love you and will you persist even after I kiss you

Goodbye for the last time will you be trying to prove it, I'm dying

To lose it, I'm losing my confidence

----

I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it

I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to

I want you, I want you, I want you, I want you

I want a, I want a, I want a, I want a coin operated boy

----

And if I has a start to wish on for my life

I can't imagine any flesh and blood could be this match

I can even take him in the bath

Coin operated boy, he may not be real experienced with girls

----

But I know, he feels like a boy should feel, isn't that the point

That is why I want a coin operated boy

With a pretty coin operated voice saying

That he loves me, that he's thinking of me

Straight and to the point that is why

I want a coin operated boy

----

<h2 id="11">"Why'd You Bring A Shotgun To The Party?"<p>The Pretty Reckless</p></h2>

Alone, afraid, the kid your mother made

Sitting in your room drooling like a loser with all this doom

You think, then you start to drink

Then you get so paranoid with all the drugs they fill you with

----

Then boom

Does it make you feel like a man?

Boom

It's not the size we understand,

Boom

You think you're gonna get with me

You're never gonna get with me

You're never gonna dance with me

----

I admit, I feel like you, like shit

But I don't go 'round and take it out on everyone about it

We're all part of the system

You wanna start a war?

You think that anyone would listen?

----

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it

Wanna make a statement? You should've come without it

----

You turn the TV on, watch it if you dare

You see a politician and you start to pull your hair

But it's all two dimension see there's really nothing there

You wanna tell them what you think you think they fuckin' care

----

And boom

Do you think they hear you now?

And boom

Making noises in the crowd, all in the way that you're using

You love it so much then why do you abuse it?

----

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it

Wanna make a statement? You should've come without it

----

We're all part of the system

Load 'em up shoot 'em down

But you keep fucking missin'

----

We're all part of the system

Load 'em up shoot 'em down

But you keep fucking missing

----

Alone afraid you wanna make them pay that’s...

----

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Everybody's got one, there's nothing new about it

Wanna get the girl? Then you should've come without it

----

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

Why'd you bring a shotgun to the party?

<h2 id="12">"Hit Me Like A Man"<p>The Pretty Reckless</p></h2>

Ow!

----

I am strong, love is evil

It's a version of perversion that is only for the lucky people

Take your time and do with me what you will

I won't mind, you know I'm ill, you know I'm ill

----

So hit me like a man and love me like a woman

Buried and sad, look me in the eyes, I want it

One will give you hell, one will give you heaven

Hit me like a man, love me like a woman

Love me like a woman

----

Love is strong, but I am evil

You are wrong, about me

Take your time, ah, play with me until

You can hear the children scream, like their stuck inside a dream

That you, ah, will

----

So hit me like a man, love me like a woman

Bury me alive, I can see it in your eyes, you want it

Some will give you pain, some will give you pleasure

Hit me like a man, love me like a woman

Love me like a woman

----

Don't you run away, run away from me, I will run away from you

Don't you run away, run away from me, I will run away from you

----

Hit me like a man, love me like a woman

From the devil deep inside, can't you see what I'm wanting?

Some will give you hell, some will give you heaven

So hit me like a man, love me like a woman

Love me like a woman

Love me like a woman

Love me like a woman, ow!

I'm tired and I

Want to go to bed

And then leave me alone

Don't try to wake me in the morning

Deep in the cell of my heart

I will feel so glad to go
