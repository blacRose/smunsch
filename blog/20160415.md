# Transphobia
Do you understand how I felt? Society is incredibly transphobic, simply by existing. They don't DISCOURAGE people from being trans. It simply implies we will cease to exist. Not necessarily "die", but that we will simply not be allowed to exist by anyone in the society. This is something that is becoming literally true in Republican states. And (kinda) don't get me *STARTED* on agender people! I'm glad you think "they" pronouns (plural! Only ever allowed to be plural!) actually make sense from the point of view that they are describing someone who is male and female. But you are, in fact, simply espousing the belief that people can *only* exist in the binary. Agender simply means, actually, **not** in the binary. Not male, not female. Society simply doesn't know how to treat that other than by simply ignoring and specifically **not allowing** that experience to exist!
Like all other things *invented* by humans, this has a name. "Transerasure". I say *"invented"* because only humans care enough about **gender** to get this *wrong*. Other animals be all: "Oh. You have (or don't) a penis. That's nice! We won't impose any 'roles' on you because those are only a 'human' thing. Their society invented a lot of stupid, frankly **bullshit** ideas. We don't need to impose on anything else on the **planet** beyond the end of our nose (or snout or wtv we have!)."
