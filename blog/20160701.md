# Drupal

## Installation

- Run `installDrupal.sh sitename`
- Creates a /var/www/sitename, git user, an explains what to do next
- Requires command `postInst.sh sitename` to run after install is run in web browser

## Configuration

- To add one user to one site, run `php /var/www/usermod.php mk "$user" "$sites" "$email" "$pass"`
- To add more, create a csv file formatted like: `user, pass, email, site`
- Then run `usermod.sh mk file.csv`

## To remove:

- A site: run `installDrupal.sh delete sitename`
- Run `php /var/www/usermod.php rm "$user" "$pass"`
- To remove more, create a csv file formatted like: `user, site`
- Then run `usermod.sh rm file.csv`

# Git config

## To add new users:

Add a `keys/USER.pub` file

Authorize them to read/write repositories as needed (or just
  authorize the group `@all`)

## To create new repositories

Just authorize writing to them and push. It's that simple! For example: let's
assume your username is
`jdoe` and you want to create a repository `myproject`.
In your clone of `gitosis-admin`, edit `gitosis.conf` and add:

	[group reponame]
	members = jdoe wsmith @anothergroup
	writable = foo bar baz/thud repo
	readonly = xyzzy

	[group anothergroup]
	members = alice bill

Commit that change and push. Then create the initial commit and push
it:

	mkdir repo
	cd repo
	git init
	git remote add origin ssh://git@universe.sonoma.edu:25000/repo.git
	# do some work, git add and commit files
	 git push --set-upstream origin master

That's it. If you now add others to `members`, they can use that
repository too.

## QuickStart

### New user

cp pubkey to `gitosis-admin/keys/user@comp.pub`

Edit gitosis.conf

Add username (user@comp) to members for repos

	git add *
	git commit -m "mm"
	git push

----

### New Repo Configuration

Add block to gitosis-admin/gitosis.conf

	[group somename]
	members = user@comp
	writable = repo

On user comp:

	mkdir repo
	cd repo
	git init
	git remote add origin ssh://git@universe.sonoma.edu:25000/repo.git
	# do some work, git add and commit files
	 git push --set-upstream origin master
