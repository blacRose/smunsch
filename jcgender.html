	<p>Making surgery a <a>requirement,</a> basically means, that they seem to think that a penis causes a man to rape. And you are doing nothing to disabuse them of that notion. You. A school. You are not bothering to try to change a blatantly untrue belief. Because, that would be more work than creating an entire accommodation. That is really, not an accommodation for me, or a problem I have. It's really an accommodation for their incredibly false, disrespectful, disgracious beliefs.</p>

	<p>But I'm pretty sure my fixation on this is a fair bit worse than before my brain injury. Whether that is because I was a white male in America and what I'm going to is a group that is more fraught than males, I still think it is worse.</p>

	<p>Also, let's look a ways down the line. After surgery. If it is not the penis that makes men more likely to rape, what is it? May it be they still don't want me in there? And following that train of thought, is it the hormones? Because the average cisgender woman has 9-59 units of Testosterone in their blood. I'm at 22 right now. I was on blockers longer than Estrogen. So saying it is T means most average cis women would be more likely to rape than I. And, in recorded history, there have been no cases of rapes by transgender people. If we go off of who commits sexual assault, we should NOT allow the current or future members of Congress to use the normal showers. There are more cases against them than transgender people.</p>

	<p>It all comes down to, you're the reticent parent… who doesn't want to tell their twelve year old child that people die, and that is the end for them.</p>

	<p>Please, ask them for a reason why they feel uncomfortable. Yes, people do need a reason… There has to be a cause for every reaction Was there ever a time you were uncomfortable with no reason? Or was it just a reason you couldn't spell out using language? And if it's that pie in the sky, ask yourself. Is this a legitimate issue or just a pie in pulling out of the sky? And if it is, can you tell me the secret to it so I can have free pie for life?</p>
